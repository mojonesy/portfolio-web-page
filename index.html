						<h2><em>My Name is Molly</em></h2>
					</header>
						<p>Hello - Thanks for visiting my portfolio page! My name is Molly Jones. I am a professional musician and aspring software developer based out of Buffalo, NY. I am currently a student in Thinkful's Online Software Engineering Flex Program and am enjoying learning about coding and web development while continuing to create music.</p>
						<p>Although I've only just begun my software development journey, I've already realized some of the many similarities that musicians and developers share:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Unlimited creative potential</li>
								<li>A passionate drive to hone their craft</li>
								<li>An ability to effectively collaborate with each other</li>
								<li>A shared interest in the devlopment of their industry</li>
							</ul>
						<p>Drawing these conclusions has made me even more eager and excited to keep learning and develop my skills. I have come to realize the potential creativity that my future projects can hold in connection with my passion for music. </p>

						<h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
					</header>
						<p>Born and raised in Buffalo, NY, I've been playing drums and percussion for over 20 years. I attended the Crane School of Music at the State University of New York at Potsdam, where I studied percussion and recieved my Bachelor's degree in Music Business. After completing an internship at the National Association of Music Merchants in California, I joined Princess Cruise Lines as a House Band Drummer, traveling the world and playing professionally.</p>
						<p>Some of my hobbies apart from learning to code and playing music include:</p>
              <img src="images/espresso.JPG" width=250px>
							<ol>
								<li>Brewing specialty coffee</li>
								<li>Fitness</li>
								<li>Photography</li>
								<li>Snowboarding</li>
							</ol>
						<p>I have been to 37 countries over the course of my career, and have experienced the wonder, excitement, and many learning opportunities that traveling and meeting people from other places has to offer. My interest in software engineering began when a fellow musician who was studying coding showed me some of her work. I became intrigued, as I had always had an interest in technology and how it functions, and realized the potential benefits and opportunities of studying this ever-evolving topic.</p>
						<p>Through my learning with Thinkful, I am developing the necessary skills to become a competent software engineer. One day I hope to contribute to the tech industry and collaborate with other like-minded and creative people while travelling the world. I would love to be able to blend my passion for music with my new-found passion for software development!</p>
